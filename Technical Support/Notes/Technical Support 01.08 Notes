Notes – 01/08 – Levels of Call Centre Processing

There are two main types of helpdesk; internal and external. Internal helpdesks are those that deal with goods/services coming from within the company,
whilst external helpdesks deal primarily with goods/services provided by manufacturers, or other external providers from outside the company.

There are generally 3 levels of support – the “Front line” “Second level”, and “Third level”.

The front line may be of two different varieties – the first of which is “Resolution” and the second is “Dispatch”.
Resolution Frontlines simply use training and experience to attempt the resolution of issues that are brought to them based on their own experience,
without needing to escalate the calls to specialised individuals.
Dispatching Frontlines, instead, are not always familiar with the products or issues with which the call is concerned, and instead are focused on forwarding the call
towards specialists, rather than trying to be knowledgeable in all facets of a business. This may be advantageous in larger businesses in which is it infeasible to
memorise details of all products/services, and how to resolve issues.

The second level of support is usually doing things other than answering calls and resolving the queries of callers – for example they may be engaged in marketing,
or other assorted tasks. Generally, they will aim to perform these tasks, alongside receiving and resolving calls.
They aim to reduce the total number of calls from individuals needing assistance, therefore they must have a thorough understanding of the potential issues to ensure
they do not occur again. 

The third level of support usually consists of specialised individuals outside of the helpdesk, and generally consists of more specialised areas of the company
for example, areas like network administrators, program developers, etc. Alternatively, these individuals may be from third party companies from which products/services
may be provided.

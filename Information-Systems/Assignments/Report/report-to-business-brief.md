## Overview of Eye Candy Cinemas
Eye Candy Cinemas is a New Zealand entertainment company, specialised in the screening of movies in theatres owned by the company. There are two cinema complexes in the repertoire of Eye Candy Cinemas - one in Auckland, and one in Wellington. The Auckland complex contains a total of six theatres, and the Wellington complex has four. Eye Candy Cinemas wishes to improve their operational efficiency through the use of a new website application, and requires overhauled information systems in order to achieve this aspiration.

The purpose of this report is to suggest appropriate information systems and database models that provide a basis for the website application of Eye Candy Cinemas. The specific metrics within the database will include cinema complex information, information regarding theatres within complexes, and movie screening information/scheduling. Additionally, Eye Candy Cinemas has specifically requested an additional function, totalling the number of movies screened per day and week - this feature is intended to allow analysis of total theatre uptime, therefore gauging of operational efficiency.

## Information Gathering for Eye Candy Cinemas 
For the purpose of providing an overhauled user experience within the new website application, information has been gathered in regards to how the system currently utilised by Eye Candy Cinemas functions. Then, using this gathered information, the old design can be reiterated upon, or overhauled entirely to ensure a positive and successful user experience.

For this purpose, **Document Analysis** was likely to be the most pivotal source of information - however, it was also performed alongside the distribution of **Questionaires**.

### Document Analysis
Document Analysis is the process of reviewing existing documentation of the original constituent parts of Eye Candy Cinemas. This process involved collection of data regarding existing systems, the rules surrounding them, key functionalities and compatabilities, as well as records of past screenings, customer manifests, online website analytics, and historical documentation of the management of the Auckland and Wellington cinema complexes.

Additionally, information regarding the competitors of Eye Candy Cinemas, including website layout/functionality, frequency of screenings, and the degree to which seats in theatres were booked by customers was collected, to allow the measurement of Eye Candy Cinemas' success against that of its competitors.

Unfortunately, the findings of the document analysis were that - when compared to competitors - the inaccessability and difficulty-of-use of Eye Candy Cinemas' website disincentivised a sizeable proportion of prospective customers from completing a booking. Additionally, the median number of bookings per theatre *(adjusted for available seats)* was on average lower than that of competitors - likely as a result of the reduced accessability. Finally, inefficiencies in operation on a theatrewide scale ensured that several hours could pass between screenings in the same theatre, when competitors provided back-to-back screenings, furthering the number of total screenings per day. In short, the overall operational efficiency of Eye Candy cinemas was found to be severely lacking following an analysis of documents.

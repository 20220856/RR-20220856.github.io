# Feasability Study for Tongariro Cinemas
The purpose of this feasability report is to assess the validity of option(s) provided during the previously provided Requirements Analysis Report, allowing for decisions to be made as to the final intended state of the website. The three primary categories to be assessed are the feasability in terms of the business/organisation itself, the technical feasability of the overhauls, and the potential financial success of the proposed changes.

## Feasability Report

The systems overhaul of Tonagariro Cinemas is extensive - effectively entailing a full overhaul of all cinema systems to modernised, digital equivalents. As explained in the Requirements Analysis Report, the primary reason for the overhaul in the first place is to ensure Tongariro Cinemas' continued ability to compete in the modern financial and cultural environment. The most important features the overhaul, in no particular order, include the implementation of a modernised web application, the complete shift to digital financial processing, streamlining and upgrading of administrative systems, and ensuring the potential for future expandability for the business.

#### Web Application Feasability
The proposed web application for Tongariro Cinemas is of high priority within the overhaul; the minimum requirements include the ability to view film listings, search and sort film screenings and times, place bookings, and find contact details of the cinema. All of these elicited requirements are feasable, and do not pose any particular issues of merit. As the website is being built from the ground-up, it can be directly integrated with the new systems of Tongariro Cinemas, therefore should not require any special considerations for backwards-compatibility or ease of integration with other systems.

#### Feasability of Full Digital Integration
Digital financial processing, coming from an area of which none is present poses a slightly more difficult challenge; as there is currently no precident for how digital finances should be handled at Tongariro Cinemas and no framework for such systems to be put in place, these need to be established from the ground-up. However, within the scheme of the overhaul, this likely will not prove to be an issue.

Digitising the administrative systems of Tongariro Cinemas will likely contribute a large portion of the total workload for the effort to update systems. There is a large quantity of manual bookkeeping currently in place at Tongariro Cinemas, none of which lends itself to being particularly easy to transfer to a digital medium - it will require a lot of work. Particular problem areas include the records of customers and past screenings, and documentations regarding existing cinema systems which will need to be analysed and sorted. This process, whilst labour-intensive and of moderately difficult is most certainly feasable for the systems overhaul.

#### Financial Feasability and Potential for Growth
A slightly different consideration is the financial feasability of the project, which is - at this point within the current iteration of the project plan - entirely sufficient. The total budget for the project remains unchanged at $50,000NZD, therefore outside of any unforseen circumstances or setbacks should more than account for enough to complete the overhaul.

"Potential Expandability" is less of a consideration during the process modernisation, but more of a concept to hold in mind for the future. The mere act of making systems at Tongariro Cinemas itself is a great step in the right direction in pursuit of this goal, but going forward, business decisions should be made with the consideration for business expandability in mind.

### Conclusion to Feasability Study for Tongariro Cinemas
As shown through the above analysis, careful planning with the stakeholders of Tongariro Cinemas has resulted in a realistic, feasabile, and relatively straightforward plan to the successful implementation of a full overhaul to the systems at the cinema complex. The only conceivable issues that could potentially arise through the process is the mild disruption of day-to-day operations for a short period of time through the installation of modern systems. This is unfortunately unavoidable to some degree, but is offset due to the existing analogue system that can continue alongside installations until it is ready to be integrated in its entirety. Everything is on-track, and the full conversion is prepared to commence.

# Feasability Study for Tongariro Cinemas
The purpose of this feasability report is to assess the validity of option(s) provided during the previously provided Requirements Analysis Report, allowing for decisions to be made as to the final intended state of the website. The three primary categories to be assessed are the feasability in terms of the business/organisation itself, the technical feasability of the overhauls, and the potential financial success of the proposed changes.

## Business Strategic Feasability
As outlined in the requirements analysis report, the stakeholders of Tongariro Cinemas LTD have a variety of expectations in regards to the outcome of the overhaul. As the proposed systems are vastly different to those currently in place at the cinema complex, it is important that the success of the new system is guaranteed before its implementation.

## Technical Feasability
The systems overhaul of Tonagariro Cinemas is extensive - effectively entailing a full overhaul from analogue systems to digital. Especially difficult areas to handle are the switch from manual bookkeeping/accounting to a digital system, and the management framework of how film screenings will be scheduled and function.

As explained in the Requirements Analysis Report, the primary reason for the overhaul in the first place is to ensure Tongariro Cinemas' continued ability to compete in the modern financial and cultural environment. The most important features the overhaul, in no particular order, include the implementation of a modernised web application, the complete shift to digital financial processing, streamlining and upgrading of administrative systems, and ensuring the potential for future expandability for the business.

The proposed web application for Tongariro Cinemas is of high priority within the overhaul; the minimum requirements include the ability to view film listings, search and sort film screenings and times, place bookings, and find contact details of the cinema. All of these elicited requirements are feasable, and do not pose any particular issues of merit. As the website is being built from the ground-up, it can be directly integrated with the new systems of Tongariro Cinemas, therefore should not require any special considerations for backwards-compatibility or ease of integration with other systems.

Digital financial processing, coming from an area of which none is present poses a slightly more difficult challenge; as there is currently no precident for how digital finances should be handled at Tongariro Cinemas and no framework for such systems to be put in place, these need to be established from the ground-up. However, within the scheme of the overhaul, this likely will not prove to be an issue.

Digitising the administrative systems of Tongariro Cinemas will likely contribute a large portion of the total workload for the effort to update systems. There is a large quantity of manual bookkeeping currently in place at Tongariro Cinemas, none of which lends itself to being particularly easy to transfer to a digital medium - it will require a lot of work. Particular problem areas include the records of customers and past screenings, and documentations regarding existing cinema systems which will need to be analysed and sorted. This process, whilst labour-intensive and of moderately difficult is most certainly feasable for the systems overhaul.

"Potential Expandability" is less of a thing to handle during the modernisation, but more of a concept to hold in mind for the future. The mere act of making systems at Tongariro Cinemas itself is a great step in the right direction in pursuit of this goal, but going forward, business decisions should be made with the consideration for business expandability in mind.

## Financial Feasability
The financial feasability of the project is - within the current iteration of the project plan - entirely sufficient.

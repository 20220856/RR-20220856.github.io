### User Research and Early Design Checks
The first step of UX design is the process of discovering user wants and needs.  This can be obtained through sources such as feedback forms for existing consumers. These may have any number of questions regarding the design in practice.

### Prototyping
Early iterations of designs are presented to users as prototypes. These are created to display how an end product will look (usually without any code involved). Prototyping allows for accelerated development and easier adaptation to the brief of a client.

Low fidelity prototypes are those that are not interactable, and serve as a bare-bones representation of the desired outcome. These generally are made first, and serve as a first step towards the final product.

High fidelity prototypes, instead, may be fully interactable, and usually are producted some time around the middle or end of the design cycle. These are used to display early iterations of how the product is intended to look in its final state -- this is to allow further finesse on additional development, and allow client briefs to be met at a greater level.

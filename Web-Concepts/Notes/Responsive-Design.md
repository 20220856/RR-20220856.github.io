## Responsive Design

Responsive designs are generally functional across different media sizes and devices. This means that a website may be functional on a mobile and a PC with little other input from the website developer.

Modern websites manage content according to the screen size of the viewing device.
CSS styling is responsible for handling responsive design. One of the syntaxes responsible for responsive styling is;

"
background-color:blue;
@media screen and (min-width:400px){background-color:green}
"

In this particular instance, the screen background will default to blue, but if the screen width is less than 400px it will make it green instead.

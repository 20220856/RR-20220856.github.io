## Javascript

Javascript is a programming language utilised by browsers.

### DOM - Document Object Model (Programming Interface)
Javascript primarily utilises <tags> in the same manner as HTML.
DOM is an intermediary stage between the running of HTML code and the displaying of rendered code on a webpage. DOM is responsible for the creation of a "Tree Structure" of the HTML source code that is interpretable by the browser.
Within this Tree Structure, elements are known as "Nodes".

## Dev-Ops
Dev-Ops is a system in which the standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLS) is split into two teams -- Development, and Operation teams.

The Development team is responsible for development activities such as the production of the software.

The Operation team is responsible for application and sales of the software, and presentation of the completed software to the client(s).

The Development and Operations teams collaborate to solve issues that may appear during any phase of the production of the software.

## Report
As TravelNZ is a provider of New Zealand tourism to an international clientele, it is critical that a website with a fantastic User Experience is the face of the company. 

Initial presentation is likely to be the most relevant factor for maintaining the interest of international site visitors, as the majority of visitors form opinions regarding the quality of a website [within less than 20 seconds](https://www.originalbox.co/blog/average-time-spent-websites#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20on,stay%20or%20leave%20your%20website?). Therefore, it is of great importance that the website makes a good first impression.

Additionally, the website must be easy to navigate and easily predictable, ensuring that international visitors know what to expect whilst navigating. This is important because [predictability ensures a positive user experience](https://uxmag.com/articles/being-predictable#:~:text=predictability%20extends%20further%20than,and%20affects%20sales%20growth%20positively.), and is integral for meeting customer expectations - especially in the tourism industry, where many alternatives are available.

In terms of the actual content to be displayed, TravelNZ's website should primarily show promotional material and suggestions from the repertoire of destinations available to the company. This may include potential destinations, special promotions, and perhaps even joint ventures with other companies *(for example, a partnership with a hotel chain)*. The website should have a basic search function, through which people can narrow suitable destinations and timeframes down for themselves, as well as a fully aggregated list of all tourism options available at this time.

For UI design, the website functions should ideally be obviously placed and clear in their purposes, and should frame the display and promotional elements without obscuring them. On the finished high fidelity prototype, I believe it would be prudent to include these design details to ensure a fully fleshed-out website;
- Quick navigation links to all pages from the main page, and a consistent header within all other pages
- A profile/login page
- An easy-to-use search function, likely utilising some form of drop-down boxes
- A "Contact Us" link, placed obviously on the main page
- Potentially an FAQ to answer the queries of visitors
- Visually appealing UI design, with well-selected image accompaniment

In conclusion, provided that the above details are included, and the usability of the website is made a high priority, I believe that

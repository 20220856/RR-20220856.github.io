## Report
As TravelNZ is a provider of New Zealand tourism to an international clientele, it is critical that a website with a fantastic User Experience is the face of the company. 

Initial presentation is likely to be the most relevant factor for maintaining the interest of interational site visitors, as the majority of visitors form opinions regarding the quality of a website [within less than 20 seconds](https://www.originalbox.co/blog/average-time-spent-websites#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20on,stay%20or%20leave%20your%20website?). Therefore, it is of great importance that the website makes a good first impression.

Additionally, the website must be easy to navigate and easily predictable, ensuring that international visitors know what to expect whilst navigating. This is important because [predictability ensures a positive user experience](https://uxmag.com/articles/being-predictable#:~:text=predictability%20extends%20further%20than,and%20affects%20sales%20growth%20positively.), and is integral for meeting customer expectations - especially in the tourism industry, where many alternatives are available.

### Project Definition and Scope
The project is to create a Food Delivery Application. This application - on the frontend at least - must contain a search function, be able to graphically display possible selections for the customer, be able to accept registrations and login information (including payment information), and potentially contain feedback/complaints processing.
The remainder of features are mostly backend, therefore not applicable to a low-fidelity prototype.

Specifically, the prototype must contain at least three specific features. In my case, these are;
#### - A login/registration page
#### - A dedicated search function and page
#### - A "Popular-Near-You" page

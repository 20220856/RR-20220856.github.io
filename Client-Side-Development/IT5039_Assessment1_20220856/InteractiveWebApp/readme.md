## IT5039 Assessment 1: Impliment Web Application - Student 20220856

For this assignment, I have chosen to utilise the provided suggestion of a Calculator Application.

The calculator (as one of this specific design should) only accepts numerical inputs, and does not allow strings. Additionally, it works flawlessly with floating point numbers.

The calculator is fully capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and expression of the modulo of two numbers.

Additionally, the calculator possesses a "Clear All" button that nullifies the fields for the first and second number inputs, and the output.

As requested in the brief, there is also a "Close Application" button, that removes all content on the page, thanking the user for using the Calculator Application.

The application is sufficiently accessable, being of crisp and clean design, with all elements clearly displayed and highlighted. The UI is simple, and easy to understand.

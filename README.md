# **Research Repository** *_- 20220856_*

This is my GitHub Research Repository, serving as a way to showcase my emerging understanding of Software Development. I am also storing my Technical Support notes here for ease of access.

## Research, and Python Koans
[Reflective Journal](./Software-Development/Reflective-Journal.md/) <br>
The general reflective journal of my thoughts and knowledge gained throughout the course

[Python Koans Completion](https://github.com/20220856/python_koans) (currently 52 completed) and [Python Kones Notes](./Software-Development/Notes/python-kones.md)<br>
I am frankly surprised by how much I have learned from, and enjoyed these Python Koans - I felt the need to include this on the main page because they are simply so interesting.

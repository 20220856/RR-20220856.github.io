# **Research Repository** *_- 20220856_*

This is my GitHub Research Repository, serving as a way to showcase my emerging understanding of Software Development. I am also storing my Technical Support notes here for ease of access.

## Research, and Python Koans
[Reflective Journal](./Software-Development/Reflective-Journal.md/) <br>
The general reflective journal of my thoughts and knowledge gained throughout the course

[Python Koans Completion](https://github.com/20220856/python_koans) (currently 52 completed) and [Python Kones Notes](./Software-Development/Notes/python-kones.md)<br>
I am frankly surprised by how much I have learned from, and enjoyed these Python Koans - I felt the need to include this on the main page because they are simply so interesting.

## Software Development
[Code](./Software-Development/Code/Python/)<br>
A collection of the code that I have personally written so far. Currently, Python is the only language in which we have written code (barring Scratch), therefore this link references directly to the Python directory. All of my code has heavy documentation, for the purpose of showing understanding.<br><br>
[Assignments](./Software-Development/Assignments/) -- [Software Project](./Software-Development/Assignments/Software/) and [Flowchart](./Software-Development/Assignments/Flowchart/)<br>
Currently obselete - there isn't a whole lot here. Plus, this repository itself is the first assignment.<br><br>
[Notes](./Software-Development/Notes/)<br>
My current notes, having been taken in classes regarding Software Development. Admittedly, there isn't a lot here, but that is due to the fact that the course is more hands-on than anything else, and my time has mostly been spent programming things myself or exploring materials provided to me on Canvas/MS Teams, rather than writing notes.<br><br>

# **Research Repository** *_- 20220856_*

### Welcome to my Repository - I'm Cameron, and I'm a Student at Whitecliffe College. <br>
Honestly, what I'm doing here is a complete perversion of GitHub's purpose - I'm more-or-less using it as a cloud-based hosting service for my notes and assignments throughout my time studying. <br>
If you stumble upon this by chance, feel free to have a look around. If not, my greetings to you, friend and/or professor.

# Information Systems

### [Main](./Information-Systems/)
### [Report to Business Brief](./Information-Systems/Assignments/Report/report-to-business-brief.md)<br>
This is my Report to Business Brief for the Case Study "Eye Candy Cinemas" - it was certainly one of the experiences I have ever had.<br>
### [Application of Information Systems to Business Brief]()

# Web Concepts

### [Main](./Web-Concepts/)
### [UI Design and Development](./Web-Concepts/Assignments/UI-Design-Development)<br>
The ONLY thing I like about this assignment is my written report. I am not - and have never claimed to be - a graphic designer, and it shows in this assignment. Somehow, still, I got a 92.5% on this.<br>
### [Prototype Implimentation]()
This one is in progress -- may God have mercy upon my soul.

# Software Development

### [Main](./Software-Development/)
### [Software Project](./Software-Development/Assignments/Software/)<br>
This is my first ever Software Project -- I'm surprised I did so well, even if it didn't end up complete. Coming into this course with next-to-zero coding knowledge or experience, I am very pleased with how things turned out here.<br>
### [Flowchart/Pseudocode](./Software-Development/Assignments/Flowchart/)
This is the Flowchart and Pseudocode for the above project. I think the flowchart is well-done, but the Pseudocode was actually for an outdated version of the code, and I didn't bring it up to scratch when I handed it in. Luckily for me, that went unnoticed, and I scored a 98% despite this.<br>

# Technical Support

### [Main](./Technical-Support/)
### [Practical Project - Case Study](./Technical-Support/Assignments/Practical-Project/)<br>
This was fine - neither good nor bad really. It was an assignment, and I did it. I got quite good results with it, but I didn't particularly enjoy doing it *(definitely felt like work)*.
### [Oral Presentation - Technical Report](./Technical-Support/Assignments/Oral-Presentation/)<br>
This Oral Presentation is actually - by far - my worst work to date. I completely fumbled the delivery, and the verdict was that my topic was too broad, which in hindsight I agree with. At the time it felt as if I was being clever by selecting a relatively all-encompassing topic, but the lecturer did not agree, and I can see why - too much content, not enough detail, not enough time. Oh well, still passed.

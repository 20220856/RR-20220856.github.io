# Reflective Journal

#### I will be including my opinions and personal insights in this document, hence the volume.

 
## First Impressions
Going into this course, I have very little coding experience, however I feel cautiously optimistic and relatively excited about the potential avenues to which this could lead me.

# Week 1

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is - as far as I'm aware - a simplified, visualised coding language. What would ordinarily be lines of code are instead divided into modular "Blocks" that are able to be manipulated, and "slotted" together to form a coherent string of commands, with little input of written code.

### What is Visual Coding?
Visual coding is - as mentioned above - a means of writing a coherent string of commands using a primarily visual methodology. This may consist of assembling "Blocks", as is the case with Scratch, or may be more complicated.

### What are some Programming Principles I have discovered?
As of yet, I have not learned how to do too much. This week functioned as a fantastic refresher on Scratch, but I am left thoroughly confused on even the basics of GitHub.

# Week 2

### What is Git?
Git is a version control software - a means to write code in a (relatively) non-convoluted and easy-to-organise way. The primary feature of Git is the ability to publish changes to temporary "Branches", before releasing said code to the main branch. An easy comparison is a "Beta". This allows updates and changes to be made without compromising the integrity of the intact code belonging to the main branch in case of errors.
Additionally, the usage of branches prevents issues from multiple developers uploading content that overwrites each member's respective code, giving time for members of a team to ensure their contributions are entirely compatable across the project. In my personal opinion, the ability to fork code is less useful when coding alone, but becomes exponentially more useful the more members are involved in a project to prevent conflicts in code.

### What is Github?
Ah, GitHub, this joy of a website. It is a cloud-hosted variant of the version-control software Git. Projects made on GitHub are accessable by multiple collaborators due to its nature as a cloud-hosted platform for coding, therefore allows significantly faster and more synergistic teamwork between members of a team. As far as I am aware, GitHub supports effectively whatever language you throw at it, but it just so happens I am knowledgable in all 0 of them. I am unsure whether this would mean different coding languages can be used in conjunction between members of a team on the same project, or if one standardised language must be selected and used by all team members. As far as I have learned so far, one of my preferred tricks is the usage of varying sequences of hashes - "#" "##" "###"

### How is my understanding so far?
I would rate my confusion as anywhere between moderate and high, but I find myself - surprisingly - not entirely lost. I am optimistic for the future.

# Week 3

### Github Comprehension
Through much trial and error, I would tentatively say that I have a solid understanding of at least the foundations of GitHub. I can navigate, manage file structure, format documents, and generally get things done without too many issues. I have not engaged with the "meat" of GitHub yet, as I have not collaboratively worked with anyone else on a group project, so my true comprehension remains to be seen. As of yet, I have simply used it as a pseudo-cloud-storage, from which I can access my work and notes at both Whitecliffe and at home. I truly dread to think how everyone else is managing - it must be difficult.

# Week 4

### Server Infrastructure
I had an excellent conversation with Sarmad today, regarding what constitutes a server. I had a misconception that for my Technical Support assignment we would be requiring a server cabinet, and other dedicated server hardware, but my assumption was incorrect; the defining factor of a "server" does not lie in the hardware, but rather the software used to manage it. Even a regular desktop computer - when installed with the correct software - could be functionally used as a server. My understanding now is that a "real", dedicated server would be entirely overkill for a network of four, responsible for managing and handling calls, and whilst the extra redundancy of the parts and security that a server cabinet provides are certainly bonuses, they are unneccesary for a small network without *too* much focus on future expandability. <br><br>This conversation cleared a lot of my confusions regarding servers, and I now understand that the phrase "Server Infrastructure" is - in my case - a more digital matter.

### Technical Support Assignment Clarification
After having repeatedly hunted my professors down to ask them questions corresponding to the assignment, servers, physical devices and network infrastructure, I feel my understanding of principles surrounding the assignment is vastly illuminated. The budget of $20,000 is for *one site only*, however this site must have capabilities to interface with, and potentially manage (depending on how ambitious I am feeling) two further sites in the future. Receiving clarification regarding the devices required, the different forms of server host that could potentially be used, and the ways in which a network like this should be structured has been very interesting. Being able to communicate with my professors in a 1-on-1 environment is an indescribable advantage - I am glad I have had the opportunity.

### Video Train, and Meanings
"Graphs" have been a central talking point of the day. Under the lens of computer science, a "graph" is a collation of data, used to illustrate the flow of information from one dataset to another. Today in class, Roman decided to provide an introspective, practical example of this - he instructed the class to gather, and have each person film another until someone went out of frame - at which event "cut!" would be yelled, and everyone would stop. It was truly peculiar - nobody managed to coordinate, and the end result was a collation of largely sporadic and uncurated videos side by side. However, the objective of the excercise was for the nature of the relationship between seemingly unrelated datapoints to be used to produce a meaningful outcome. It is intended to be an artistic rendition of Peer-to-Peer communication within a network. In my personal opinion, the example was a bit outlandish, but I've come to grasp that the outlandishness was the entire point; through forcing an unusual perspective, creative freedom of interpretation is exercised. I have a better understanding writing this now, than when the demonstration was in effect *(ie. I was entirely clueless at the time)*

# Week 5

### Stand-Up AGILE Coding Ritual
Today, Roman took us through our first taste of an - allegedly - real world AGILE ritual; he had the class assemble into a circle, and share certain information and ideas for our projects. Whilst I understand the exercise was intended to demonstrate the building of camraderie between peers, and allow greater collaboration between members of a team, I feel that in this particular instance, not much meaning was carried behind the gesture, as everyone is working separately on their own projects. Later on this week, we will be doing more AGILE rituals with Roman's guidance. Throughout the AGILE ritual, it seemed to me that a lot of ideas from others were either overambitious for their experience in coding, or outright impossible for this level - which is somewhat of a bad omen for peoples' assumed understandings of the programming we have attempted so far. However, it was interesting to hear Roman's suggestions about my concept of a non-scratch-based 2D/Isometrical visual game of some sort, apparently there is a leftover course within Whitecliffe to facilitate this sort of activity - I'll have to look into it.

### Self Reflections
I am - so far - quite impressed with the progress I have made in Software Development. Honestly I am incredibly surprised I have enjoyed it to the degree I have. Coming into this course, I had been under the impression that Software Development was not for me, and just a necessary part of the course to pass Technical Support, however having done it, I now see that this is absolutely not the case. I understand that we have - so far - barely touched on what it would mean to coordinate in a team with programming, as fully-fledged Software Developers do, but from what we have done so far, I find my curiosity piqued, and myself surprisingly engaged with the course material. If you're reading this, Roman, my interest is probably largely in part to your teaching style - it makes it very easy to stay engaged with your lessons, and absorb course contents.

In terms of any struggles I have had with this course so far, I must say they are few and far-between. My understanding has generally been sound, and anywhere I have been lacking I feel I have been able to quickly bring myself back up to speed. I cannot say the content is easy - because it definitely isn't straightforward coming from the standpoint of someone who has minimal coding experience, however my limited background in programming (consisting solely of a half-a-year secondary school curriculum in 2018, in which young me barely paid attention) has - surprisingly - laid the groundworks for my understanding in this course. Sure, that quickly wore off as we became more immersed in the course contents, but it prevented any initial feelings of being out of my depth, which I feel has provided me a real, tangible, psychological advantage over some of my peers, who I have seen be, unfortunately, seemingly out of their depths since day one.

I will also answer one of Roman's proposed items for this Research Repository, purely because I think it is a funny theoretical;

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Well, that really depends on whom I am trying to describe programming to - I feel I could provide vastly different answers based on the circumstance;

To a close friend of mine, I might tell them that they really ought to know about what programming is without having to ask me, but that it is - to summarise, a way for people to write in a certain way - called "coding", using a piece of software that can turn what you wrote into something a computer can understand.

However to - for example - my mother, I would probably tell her that she doesn't need to worry about it, because she wouldn't understand, and we'd both probably end up laughing and she'd agree.

Perhaps to a prospective employer? First of all, I would be disappointed, but unfortunately unsurprised that a potential employer was clueless about coding. Depending on how I felt things were going, I may either try to provide a genuine, simplified explanation, with them hopefully following along, **OR** launch into a spiel involving as many buzzwords as possible, intentionally obfuscating a relatively easy-to-describe topic in order to seem more qualified -- might make me look good, might not. Who knows.

And to you, Roman, I would try to provide as textbook-an-answer as I could, since I am being marked on this;

### Research, and Inspirations

[This GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) has served as a godsend when it comes to trying to figure out how to format on Github. Markdown hasn't been touched on at all in class, so I was more or less stumbling around blind before I found this expressive and concise repository full of information regarding exactly what I was looking for.

I feel associating with my peers, and doing my best to assist them in their learning has also greatly expanded my own understanding of the course content so far, and has been extremely mutually beneficial. As the expression goes, it turns out you do not truly understand something until you can teach it to another person - something I came to realise when I would try to explain something, only to come up short myself. This experience has really helped me expand my understanding of areas I may have otherwise overlooked, and not even realised I didn't understand.

### My thoughts on the Reflective Journal
Honestly, I have very mixed feelings - this reflective journal has definitely gotten my narrative mind flowing, and thinking about how to put coding concepts into words that can be understood with relative ease, certainly helping me to expand my understanding. Throughout, I have tried to generally write in a concise, informative way, both for myself and for the purpose of marking, and that has been great for ensuring that I understand the fundamentals. However, with writing a reflective journal, I cannot help but feel like a lot of time has been detracted from course contents that could otherwise have been spent furthering our understandings of programming principles. Writing this, I know that everyone learns differently, and that different approaches have varying degrees of success for people, but it feels like the process of reflection is more serving to sharpen my literary skills than anything software-related. I suppose there is a lot to take into account when it comes to the assignment of coursework, and I certainly can't claim to know best, and hell, maybe just the way I've chosen to lay the reflective journal out has made it more literary than that of others -- I truly have no clue.
To summarise, I think it's an excellent teaching tool, but the reflective aspect doesn't really click with me - that's something I like to do as I learn in the first place.

In terms of the quality of my work, I'd like to think that I have done a very good job, and have completely fulfulled the requirements for full marks on the Research Repository. The final decision obviously does not fall to me, but I feel the quality of my work is - as far as research repositories go - quite high.

### My thoughts on the Course as a whole
The course itself has been - for lack of a better word - fantastic so far. I am really astounded at the quality of teaching compared to some other institutions I have studied at in the past, and I've honestly had an excellent time learning both Software Development, and Technical Support. In fact, I have decided that I will almost certainly be attending next year as well, to further my education from just a Diploma in Technical Support. I didn't think I would be enjoying this as much as I am, but I find myself pleasantly surprised.

I don't really have too much to say about the course as a whole -- it's really good. I'm enjoying myself, and interested in the content. I'm certainly happy with that.

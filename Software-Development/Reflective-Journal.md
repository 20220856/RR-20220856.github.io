## First Impressions
Going into this course, I have very little coding experience, and what little I have learned while attempting to navigate GitHub so far has both been highly confusing, and greatly euphoric when I achieve success. I'm excited to see what more I can do.

## Week 1

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is - as far as I'm aware - a simplified, visualised coding language. What would ordinarily be lines of code are instead divided into modular "Blocks" that are able to be manipulated, and "slotted" together to form a coherent string of commands, with little input of written code.

### What is Visual Coding?
Visual coding is - as mentioned above - a means of writing a coherent string of commands using a primarily visual methodology. This may consist of assembling "Blocks", as is the case with Scratch, or may be more complicated.

### What are some Programming Principles I have discovered?
As of yet, I have not learned how to do too much. This week functioned as a fantastic refresher on Scratch, but I am left thoroughly confused on even the basics of GitHub. As far as I am aware, GitHub supports effectively whatever language you throw at it, but it just so happens I am knowledgable in all 0 of them. Only time will tell.

## Week 2

### What is Git?
Git is a version control software - a means to write code in a (relatively) non-convoluted and easy-to-organise way. The primary feature of Git is the ability to publish changes to temporary "Branches", before releasing said code to the main branch. An easy comparison is a "Beta". This allows updates and changes to be made without compromising the integrity of the intact code belonging to the main branch in case of errors.
Additionally, the usage of branches prevents issues from multiple developers uploading content that overwrites each member's respective code - giving time for members of a team to ensure code is entirely compatable across the project. In my personal opinion, the ability to fork code is less useful when coding alone, but becomes exponentially more useful the more members are involved in a project to prevent conflicts in code.

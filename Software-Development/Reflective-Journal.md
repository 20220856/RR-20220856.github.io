# Research Repository 

## I will be including my opinions and personal insights in this document, hence the volume.
 
 
 
## First Impressions
Going into this course, I have very little coding experience, and what little I have learned while attempting to navigate GitHub so far has both been highly confusing, and greatly euphoric when I achieve success. I'm excited to see what more I can do.
 
 
 
# Week 1

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is - as far as I'm aware - a simplified, visualised coding language. What would ordinarily be lines of code are instead divided into modular "Blocks" that are able to be manipulated, and "slotted" together to form a coherent string of commands, with little input of written code.

### What is Visual Coding?
Visual coding is - as mentioned above - a means of writing a coherent string of commands using a primarily visual methodology. This may consist of assembling "Blocks", as is the case with Scratch, or may be more complicated.

### What are some Programming Principles I have discovered?
As of yet, I have not learned how to do too much. This week functioned as a fantastic refresher on Scratch, but I am left thoroughly confused on even the basics of GitHub.



# Week 2

### What is Git?
Git is a version control software - a means to write code in a (relatively) non-convoluted and easy-to-organise way. The primary feature of Git is the ability to publish changes to temporary "Branches", before releasing said code to the main branch. An easy comparison is a "Beta". This allows updates and changes to be made without compromising the integrity of the intact code belonging to the main branch in case of errors.
Additionally, the usage of branches prevents issues from multiple developers uploading content that overwrites each member's respective code, giving time for members of a team to ensure their contributions are entirely compatable across the project. In my personal opinion, the ability to fork code is less useful when coding alone, but becomes exponentially more useful the more members are involved in a project to prevent conflicts in code.

### What is Github?
Ah, GitHub, this joy of a website. It is a cloud-hosted variant of the version-control software Git. Projects made on GitHub are accessable by multiple collaborators due to its nature as a cloud-hosted platform for coding, therefore allows significantly faster and more synergistic teamwork between members of a team. As far as I am aware, GitHub supports effectively whatever language you throw at it, but it just so happens I am knowledgable in all 0 of them. I am unsure whether this would mean different coding languages can be used in conjunction between members of a team on the same project, or if one standardised language must be selected and used by all team members. As far as I have learned so far, one of my preferred tricks is the usage of varying sequences of hashes - "#" "##" "###"

### How is my understanding so far?
I would rate my confusion as anywhere between moderate and high, but I find myself - surprisingly - not entirely lost. I am optimistic for the future.

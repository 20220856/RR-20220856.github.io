Detailed Pseudocode for Knight's Tour problem

---

import os
import pygame

create window, set dimensions, and set window name using Pygame

create function "create_board":
  set first white square generation position
  set first black square generation position
  
  set loop-counter to 0
  
  set square-width and height (100)
  set board-width (in squares)
  set board-height (in squares)
  
  set squares-across counter to 0 (new board)
  set squares-down counter to 0 (new board)
  
  for i in range (board height):                                                    ### defined by user above - repeat until "board-height" is reached
    while the squares-across counter is less than half of the board width:          ### this is so that HALF of the width is take up by either black or white
      draw a white square at first white square generation position * 2             ### to ensure that squares are spread across screen correctly
      draw a black square at first black square generation position * 2             ### specifically positioned as to be in between white squares
      add 1 to squares-across
      add the width of a chess square + two pixels to the white starting position   ### to prepare the spacing for the next square generation
      add the width of a chess square + two pixels to the black starting position
    
    increase the squares-down counter by the height of a chess square + two pixels  ### marking the end of the first row
    set squares across to 0                                                         ### to facilitate the drawing of a new row
    if loop-counter is an even number:
      the white square is drawn first
    else:
      the black square is drawn first

### This is the end of the function "create_board". All in all, it draws a chessboard on the window, with size according to user specifications. It is always square or rectangular.

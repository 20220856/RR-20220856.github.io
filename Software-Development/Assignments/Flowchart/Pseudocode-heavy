Detailed Pseudocode for Knight's Tour problem

---

import os
import pygame

create window, set dimensions, and set window name using Pygame

create function "create_board":
  set first white square generation position
  set first black square generation position
  
  set loop counter to 0
  
  set square width and height (100)
  set board width (in squares)
  set board height (in squares)
  
  set squares-across counter to 0 (new board)
  set squares-down counter to 0 (new board)
  
  for i in range (board height):                                                    ### defined by user above
    while the squares-across counter is less than half of the board width:          ### this is so that HALF of the width is take up by either black or white
      draw a white square at first white square generation position * 2             ### to ensure that squares are spread across screen correctly
      draw a black square at first black square generation position * 2             ### specifically positioned as to be in between white squares
      add 1 to squares-across
      add the width of a chess square + two pixels to the white starting position   ### to prepare the spacing for the next square generation
      add the width of a chess square + two pixels to the black starting position
    
    increase

The general plan so far;
isometric game on pygame, simple grid layout.
needs to be navigable by a "player character" of some sort
that is the BARE minimum for THURSDAY.

some kind of obstacle/terrain for the grid map
npc entities / score

easy enough

# If feeling particularly gigachad - do knight's tour problem

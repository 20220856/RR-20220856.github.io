### What can Python do?
Python can be used to create applications, connect to database systems (+reading and modifying files), perform complex mathematics, data handling, and rapid prototyping of code. Python works on many different platforms and operating systems. Additionally, Python is an interpreter system, so can be executed directly, rather than needing to be compiled before it can be run.

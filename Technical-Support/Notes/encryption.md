# Encryption
### Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is a system in which the same key is used to both lock and unlock files, and multiple copies of a key may exist at the same time.
### Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encription, instead, is a system in which different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt files, and using the same key to either encrypt or decrypt will not yield results.<br><br>

# Session-2, Thursday – Week-5

## Task-1: You have been given a list of IP addresses:  

1) 69.40.67.216/30
2) 19.227.96.150/22 
3) 133.105.246.11/29 

Identify the following for each IP address: 
### A) Class 
1 Class A
2 Class A
3 Class B

### B) IP in binary 
1 01000101.00101000.01000011.00110110
2 00010011.11100011.01100000.10010110
3 10000101.01101001.11110110.00011101

### C) Subnet mask 
1 255.255.255.252
2 255.255.252.0
3 255.255.255.248

### D) Subnet in binary 
1 11111111.11111111.11111111.11011000 = 00110110
2 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000 = 10010110
3 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 = 00011101

## Task-2:  You have a class ‘C’ IP address 205.11.2.0, you have to make 30 subnets. 
-What is the subnet mask for maximum number of hosts
255.255.255.0 = 24 

### How many hosts can each subnet have? 
254

### What is the IP address of host 3 on subnet 2? 
205.11.2.4

# This is not correct - fix it

## Task-3:  
Your organization has been assigned the network number 150.25.0.0/16 and it needs to create a set of subnets that supports up to 150 hosts on each subnet. 

### Calculate the subnet mask 
255.255.0.0

### Find the IP address of host 5 on subnet 2 
150.25.6.2

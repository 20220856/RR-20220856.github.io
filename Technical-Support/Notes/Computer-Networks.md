### What is a Network?
A Network - at its simplest - is a connection between two or more destinations. Anything that can be identified as a single entity can be included within a network. A computer network is, specifically, a network involving the communications of a computer.

### Network Topologies
A network topology is how a network is organised and structured, and how they communicate. There are a variety of "templates" for network topologies; including "Star", "Mesh", "Bus", "Ring", and "Hybrid".

#### Star Topologies
A star topology involves a certain device at the center of the infrastructure to which other devices are connected, responsible for the communication between all computers/devices on the network. This comes with the drawbacks of lack of redundancy, inability for individual devices to communicate, and a high pressure on the reliability of the managing device. However, it also allo

#### Mesh Topologies
Mesh topologies have direct connections between EVERY device on the network, without a central managing device. This may be benificial because of the direct connection between them (hence faster connection), but this is only effective for networks of few devices due to the logistical challenges of physically connecting all devices together with cabling.

#### Bus Topologies
A bus tolopology involves all devices on a network being connected to a central "bus" cable. 

#### Ring Topologies
Ring topologies involve all devices being connected on a network, but using other devices as intermediaries. This means that if - for example - device A and device C want to communicate, the information must pass through device B to reach its intended destination. This may be benificial due to the comparatively low infrastructure cost of a ring topology, but potentially detrimental due to its reliance on other devices to be online at all times for the function of the topology.

#### Hybrid Topologies
Hybrid topologies - as the name infers - is a combination between multiple topology infrastructures. This is likely to be the general structure within most networks, as a hybrid topology may bring the benefits of all whilst eliminating the negatives.

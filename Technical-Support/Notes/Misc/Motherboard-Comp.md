# Components of a Motherboard

### CPU
Central Processing Unit – responsible for general computation and is the main source of processing power in a computer system. It primarily processes arithmetic and logical operations within a system, pertaining to numerical processing and logic gates. <br>

### RAM
Random Access Memory – RAM is responsible for the short-term storing of data whilst calculations requiring said data are underway. It has significantly faster times to access than other storage such as HDDs or SSDs, hence its necessity for quick calculation.

### BIOS
Basic Input-Output System – The BIOS is responsible for initialisation of hardware in a computer, as well as the booting of the main Operating System. This ensures everything is in working order before activating hardware-reliant software.  

### PCI
Peripheral Component Interconnect – These are slots on the motherboard responsible for connections with external peripherals such as external sound or network cards.

### AGP
Accelerated Graphics Port – This part is responsible for accommodating an external graphics device (primarily graphics cards), for the processing of more graphically-intensive activities (such as rendering).

### Bridges (North + South)
The north bridge is directly adjunct to the CPU, and acts as a medium for communication with the rest of the motherboard on a rapid basis (primarily for communication with the RAM, PCIs and AGPs). The south bridge primarily communicates with the north bridge, acting for a medium with which it can access other motherboard-integrated components.
 
### Ports (Serial + Parallel)
These are the two types of connection within a motherboard for external peripherals – Serial ports are single connections that transmit single bits of information at a time from peripherals. Parallel ports, however, can transmit multiple bits of information at the same time (generally 8 bits).

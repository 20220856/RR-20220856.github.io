# Call Prioritisation System for Spring Computers
In environments expecting a high volume of incoming calls, it is important to have a system for prioritisation in place, as some calls may be more urgent that others, and due to logistical constraints, they cannot of course all be answered at once. Therefore, a call prioritisation system must be provided; something that partitions calls into groups of respective urgency based on their reasons for calling.

For example, a business having a technical fault that entirely halts production would be a more pressing issue to Spring Computers than an individual who cannot connect to their wifi at home. It is important to have a call prioritisation tree in order to solve urgent issues posthaste, even at the expense of less pressing issues having to wait a few minutes longer in the queue.

For the specific case of Spring Computers, I would advise using a system akin to that shown below;

# Call Priorities

### Highest Priority - Critical / Emergency Issues
### Second Priority - Important Issues / Longterm Degradation
### Third Priority - Non-Critical Issues / Technical Support
### Low Priority - Ineffectual / Cosmetic Issues

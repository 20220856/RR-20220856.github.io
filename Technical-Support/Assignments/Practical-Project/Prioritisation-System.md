# Call Prioritisation System for Spring Computers
In environments expecting a high volume of incoming calls, it is important to have a system for prioritisation in place, as some calls may be more urgent that others, and due to logistical constraints, they cannot of course all be answered at once. Therefore, a call prioritisation system must be provided; something that partitions calls into groups of respective urgency based on their reasons for calling.

For example, a business having a technical fault that entirely halts production would be a more pressing issue to Spring Computers than an individual who cannot connect to their wifi at home. It is important to have a call prioritisation tree in order to solve urgent issues posthaste, even at the expense of less pressing issues having to wait a few minutes longer in the queue.

For the specific case of Spring Computers, I would advise using a system akin to that shown below;

# Call Priorities

### Highest Priority - Critical / Emergency Issues
For Spring Computers, the highest priority issues would be those in which businesses are unable to function, or information is put at risk. For example, faults in necessary computer systems, data breaches/losses, and errors that cause great reductions in operational efficiency would be matters of critical priority. These should be handled first, and every step should be taken to resolve the issue.

### Second Priority - Important Issues / Longterm Degradation
The second highest priority for Spring Computers should be ensuring that all maintainence requests by clients, and other important issues be resolved as soon as possible. These may include faults that strain the business without outright ceasing operations (such as a fault in automated systems), or physical degradation of non-critical components. These - whilst important - are able to be handled second due to their nature as non-essential issues (characterised by the fact that the business can - if only temporarily - operate without them).

### Third Priority - Non-Critical Issues / Technical Support
The third priority of Spring Computers should be that of non-critical issues that pose no danger to businesses or individuals, and other support to existing customers. Components that still function, but suffer a decrease in performance or stability fall into this category, alongside issues that may be inconvenient, but are able to be overlooked. These are not a higher priority because businesses and individuals can still function without them, even if operations are somewhat inconvenienced.

### Low Priority - Ineffectual / Cosmetic Issues
The lowest priority for Spring Computers should be issues that are somewhat irrelevant to business operations, and pleasantries such as feedback or inquiries. Whilst these can still be important, their priority is lower than other issues because they are not time-sensitive issues, therefore can be deferred and handled later on. This may include issues such as cosmetic wear-and-tear on devices, minor or barely noticeable technical faults, or an individual wanting to complain about a late delivery.

# Prioritisation in Practice

An excellent contender for managing calls is [3CS Phone Systems](https://www.3cx.com/pbx/), the software I will be recommending for this purpose. This software is more than fit for the purpose of handling calls for a small business like Spring Computers, and has a plethora of synergistic elements that work well within the established network of the new Auckland site. The [Self-Managed Dedicated PRO](https://www.3cx.com/ordering/pricing/) is a perfect fit for the needs of Spring Computers - everything is locally hosted on the server onsite, and it holds a full suite of necessary tools for managing and making calls, including prioritisation, and other optimisation metrics for improving outcomes. 

The current selection and budget accounts for *four* calls simultaniously, paid for for the duration of *five* years. This can be easily increased by modifying the requirements on the website, therefore the two future sites can also be managed by the same software with ease.

# Summary / Conclusion

To summarise, I believe the brief has been entirely fulfilled;

- The Hardware/Software components and Network Devices have been listed.
- The Communication Channel has been reported.
- The Costs for all requirements have been listed.
- The Call Prioritisation System has been described in detail.
- Rationale and Justification has been provided for each Component.

Out of the available budget of $20,000, $15,973.70 has been used for the total design, bringing the surplus budget to $4026.30. This could be used for further development of future sites, or to further improve the current Auckland site in whatever ways are desired - there have been acommodations for further expansions, so perhaps that could be utilised with this fund.

I believe that all selected hardware is suitable for purpose, and that the focus on providing a quality, secured network will serve the purpose of this new site well. Confidential information regarding clients, other companies, or other actors related to Spring Computers needs to be treated with utmost security, hence the robusticity of the components selected, and the focus upon multiple layers of security.

To conclude, the features of the existing network, coupled with its future potential for expansion completely fulfils the brief provided by Spring Computers, and leaves vast possibilities for the future of the business.

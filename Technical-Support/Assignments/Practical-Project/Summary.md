# Summary / Conclusion

To summarise, I believe the brief has been entirely fulfilled;

- The Hardware/Software components and Network Devices have been listed.
- The Communication Channel has been reported.
- The Costs for all requirements have been listed.
- The Call Prioritisation System has been described in detail.
- Rationale and Justification has been provided for each Component.

Out of the available budget of $20,000, $15,973.70 has been used for the total design, bringing the surplus budget to $4026.30. This could be used for further development of future sites, or to further improve the current Auckland site in whatever ways are desired - there have been acommodations for further expansions, so perhaps that could be utilised with this fund.

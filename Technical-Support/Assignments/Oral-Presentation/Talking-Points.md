### Overview / Brief Description

- What is Cybersecurity?
- Why is it important for a business?
- End results of implementation in context for ACME (business and customers)

### The benefits of expanding employee cybersecurity training

- Specific cybersecurity strategies can be better utilised by employees
- IT education of employees at a company reduces technological illiteracy and thus improves safety
- Directives and protocols can be directly established on an as-needed basis to ensure maximum security

### Potential drawbacks of expanding employee cybersecurity training

- Higher costs accounting for employee training and additional protocols
- Longer time for employees to be trained
- Administrative issues that come with providing additional training (as with any skill)

### How expanding cybersecurity training will benefit customers of the small business

- Customers can be more assured in the security of their own data
- Reduction in total cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities regardless of infrastructure
- Establishing proper procedures for the accessing of customer data reduces the possibilities of data leaks

### Overall conclusion / recommendations for implimentation

- I WOULD recommend the expansion of cybersecurity training for ACME's employees, as it is important to know how to utilise cybersecurity solutions
- The implimentation of such solutions will benefit both in the short and long-term, as data secutiry will likely immediately improve

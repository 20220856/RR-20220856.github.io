# Points for Presentation on Employee Cybersecurity Training

### Overview / Brief Description

- What is Cybersecurity?
- Why is it important for a business?
- End results of implementation in context for ACME (business and customers)

### The benefits of expanding employee cybersecurity training

- Specific cybersecurity strategies can be better utilised by employees
- IT education of employees at a company reduces technological illiteracy and thus improves safety
- Directives and protocols can be directly established on an as-needed basis to ensure maximum security

### Potential drawbacks of expanding employee cybersecurity training

- Higher costs accounting for employee training and additional protocols
- Longer time for employees to be trained
- Administrative issues that come with providing additional training (as with any skill)

### How expanding cybersecurity training will benefit customers of the small business

- Customers can be more assured in the security of their own data
- Reduction in total cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities regardless of infrastructure
- Establishing proper procedures for the accessing of customer data reduces the possibilities of data leaks

### Overall conclusion / recommendations for implimentation

- I WOULD recommend the expansion of cybersecurity training for ACME's employees, as it is important to know how to utilise cybersecurity solutions
- The implimentation of such solutions will benefit both in the short and long-term, as data secutiry will likely immediately improve

# Specific Talking Points

### The Reliance of other forms of Digital Security on correct and thorough employee training
Emphasis must be placed upon the fact that other forms of digital security are almost entirely useless if they are not implemented correctly and are unknown to members of staff.

### The all-round benefits to a business of having a higher-trained workforce
Relatively self-explanatory

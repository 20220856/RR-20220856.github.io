# Reflections for Presentation on Cybersecurity Training

### My own interest in pursuing a non-standard topic
My understanding is that many of my peers are talking about specific network infrastructure or components, whilst I have chosen to move the scope of the project out to the training of employees as a whole. Whilst this does still fulfill the brief in its entirety, I hope that the "outside-the-box" approach does not hamper the grading of this assignment. Rather, I would hope for it to assist me in achieving a high mark.

### Completion of marking rubric
Using the marking rubric as a template for the assignment almost feels unfair - it explains exactly what is required, and to a lesser degree how must time must be spend on each segment. I'm unsure as to whether the presentation will reach 10 minutes as is expected, but on the same note I *highly* doubt that any other presentations do either. Hopefully I am knowledgable enough to contend with audience questions (although I am truthfully sceptical that there will be any in the first place).

### How do I feel about the quality of my own work?
I feel that the best thing about my work is the unique-ish angle from which I have approached the brief. I suspect nobody else has done anything similar - I just hope it does not come back to bite me. I feel that the quality of my presentation itself is relatively high, and I do not doubt my own ability to improvise a speech alongside the written information on PowerPoint. I can only hope that there are no "curveball" questions outside of the realm of my understanding, although I fail to see how there could be in the first place - my topic is self-explanatory and uncomplicated, and I feel I can deliver it in an informative manner that should at the very least reduce the volume of questions comparative to those of other presentations.

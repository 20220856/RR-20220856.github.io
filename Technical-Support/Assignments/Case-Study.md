# Technical Support Case Study - Establish a Network for an Organisation

### Task: Design a Network with the following requirements;

- The ability to connect four computers cohesively.
- Ensure there is a centralised printer accessable to all systems.
- Ensure connections and communications can be made between multiple sites.
- Provide a suite of software for monitoring and managing calls from clients.
- Provide a prioritisation system for handling calls.
- Allow for reasonable future expansion of site(s).

### Additionally, the following must be planned;

- Hardware and Software components, and network devices required.
- The communication channel to connect the multiple sites together.
- The ability to connect a further two sites to the network in future.
- The costs associated with purchasing components and establishing infrastructure.
- Rationale and reasoning for the selection of components must be shown.
#### The site must be prepared for future expansion to two further sites, therefore sufficient server infrastructure is required.

### The total available budget is $20,000 NZD.
